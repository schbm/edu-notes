# Physical Layer
- Transports bits across media
- Accepts frame from Data Link Layer and encodes it as a series of signals
- Can be wired or wireless
- Network Interface Card (NIC) connects a device

## Standards

![Physical Layer Standards](physical_layer_standards.PNG)

## Encoding
- Bits are encoded into a pattern of light, sound, or electrical impulses
- Must be in a appropriate format for the medium
- Destination must be able to decode signals to interpret the message

### Signaling
- Describes how the bit values are representet on the medium
- Method will vary based on the medium type
