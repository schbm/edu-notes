# Syntax

In predicate logic, statements are made up of _predicates_, which are expressions that can be either true or false, and _variables_, which represent objects or values. Predicates can be combined using logical connectives to form complex statements.

The basic building blocks of predicate logic are:

- _Atomic formulas_, which are predicates applied to a specific set of variables. For example, `P(x)` is an atomic formula where `P` is a predicate and `x` is a variable.
- _Logical connectives_, which are used to combine atomic formulas to form more complex statements. The most common logical connectives are `and`, `or`, `not`, and `if-then`.
- _Quantifiers_, which are used to specify the generality of a variable. The most common quantifiers are `for all` and `there exists`.

# Semantics

The meaning of a statement in predicate logic is determined by its _truth value_, which is either true or false. The truth value of a statement is determined by the truth values of its component atomic formulas and the rules of the logical connectives used to combine them.

For example, the statement `P(x) and Q(x)` is true if and only if both `P(x)` and `Q(x)` are true.

# Rules of Inference

In predicate logic, _rules of inference_ are used to deduce new statements from a given set of statements. The most common rule of inference is _modus ponens_, which states that if `P` implies `Q` and `P` is true, then `Q` must also be true.

For example, if we know that `P(x)` implies `Q(x)` and we also know that `P(x)` is true, we can deduce that `Q(x)` must also be true.

# Examples

Here are some examples of statements in predicate logic:

- `P(x) and Q(x)`: This statement is true if and only if both `P(x)` and `Q(x)` are true.
- `P(x) or Q(x)`: This statement is true if and only if at least one of `P(x)` and `Q(x)` is true.
- `not P(x)`: This statement is true if and only if `P(x)` is false.
- `for all x, P(x)`: This statement is true if and only if `P(x)` is true for all values of `x`.
- `there exists x such that P(x)`: This statement is true if and only if there is at least one value of `x` for which `P(x)` is true.
